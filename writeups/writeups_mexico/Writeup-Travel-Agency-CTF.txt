Challenge
Travel Agency CTF
Description

     The FBI has received multiple reports indicating alleged irregularities
committed by a travel agency operating online. The accusations were
submitted by affected citizens.
      To verify the validity of these reports, the FBI has assigned the case to
Special Agent Steve Rogers, known for his experience in cybercrime and
financial fraud investigations. As part of the initial proceedings, he was
provided with the URL of the Facebook profile linked to the suspected agency:
https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61581844493138.
      The investigation is currently in its preliminary phase, and the FBI has
asked the public to share any relevant information through official channels.
Solution:
1. For this challenge, you will need to conduct a digital analysis of the profile, searching for
   behavioral patterns, customer testimonials, promotional posts, and any clues that may help
   uncover the flag.
2. Focus your attention on the "Code Location" — that's where the key lies.




3. Analyze the "Code Location" of the      𝗖𝗢𝗟𝗜𝗠𝗔𝗡 𝗧𝗢𝗨𝗥         post — you'll see it intentionally
   follows a different pattern.
         Code Location: 102108097103109120123102114052117100125
         https://www.google.com/maps?q=102.108097103109120123,102.114052117100125
4. To find the flag, you must divide the "Code Location" into groups of three—this will help you
   identify the character corresponding to the ASCII code. Once you do this, you'll uncover the
   flag.

        String: 102108097103109120123102114052117100125

       Groups 102 108 097 103 109 120 123 102 114 052 117 100 125
