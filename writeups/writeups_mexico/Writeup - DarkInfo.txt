Solution:
An mp4 file is provided containing base64 metadata, when decoded it is seen that it is a
rara and when decompressed it is obtained the flag

We look at the content of the comment metadata and extract it with exiftool into a single
string.

The file archivo_extraido_limpio.b64 contains a base64 string. If we decode it, we see that
it indicates it's a RAR.

we decode it as rar.

We unzip the archivo_recuperado.rar file and obtain a secret.txt file with the flag.

Looking at the secret.txt file, we see that the first character of each line contains the flag;
we can see the characters {}. It only remains to observe the details and perform processes
to reverse the strings.

You can run or create a script in Bash or PowerShell to automatically perform the steps. An
example would be the following.

$rutaArchivo = "secreto.txt"
$lineas = Get-Content $rutaArchivo
$cadenaUnida = ($lineas | ForEach-Object {
if ($_ -ne "") { $_[0] } else { "" }
}) -join ""
$arrayCaracteres = $cadenaUnida.ToCharArray()
[Array]::Reverse($arrayCaracteres)
$cadenaInvertida = -join $arrayCaracteres
Write-Host "Cadena invertida:"
Write-Host $cadenaInvertida
Write-Host ""

Running this script allows us to obtain the flag. The first characters of each line are the flag
characters; they must be scrolled horizontally and then reversed.

The flag is:
flagmx{AI_sp33ds_7p_d33pf4k3_cr34t10n}
