Solution:
A binary file that must be converted to PDF and obtain the flag of the text that is contained
in the PDF itself.
The contents of the bin.bin file are displayed with the cat command. We notice that it
indicates it's a PDF.

It's already been detected as a PDF. We convert the binary to PDF with the following
command:

xxd -r -b bin.bin > restaurado.pdf

We open the PDF and see its contents. The only text that appears is:
666c61676d787b41495f67336e3372347433645f6334747d

Analysis of the string indicates that it is hexadecimal. We convert it to text as follows:
echo "666c61676d787b41495f67336e3372347433645f6334747d" | xxd -r -p
We get the flag

The flag is:
flagmx{AI_g3n3r4t3d_c4t}
