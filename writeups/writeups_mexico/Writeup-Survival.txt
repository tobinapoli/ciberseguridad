Solution:

The file.img file is a clone of a USB made with dd. Contains a txt file with the flag removed,
but no data recovery is required.


The challenge is ultimately easy to solve. You must analyze the file "file" to determine if it
is a disk image.


Analysis examples




After determining that it is a disk image file, we can unzip it with 7zip and analyze the
contents.
We analyze the contents of the ".Trash-1000" directory and there is a "flag" file.




When opening it with the notes editor we see a base64 string




In Linux you can decode to base64 with the following command
echo "ZmxhZ214e3BsNHkxbmdfdzF0aF9kNHQ0X3IzYzB2M3I3fQ==" | base64 –decode




The flag is:
                     flagmx{pl4y1ng_w1th_d4t4_r3c0v3r7}
